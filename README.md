### Photoshop CC 2015.5 Installer Issue
Right now, I have an issue with my extensions installers for Photoshop CC 2015.5!

#### *Temporary Solutions*
1. **Simply install the Scripts with no UI**
	* Copy the "AnimDessin2-Scripts" and/or "AnimCouleur2-Scripts" folders in your Programs/Applications > "Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.5" (or your version) > "Presets" > "Scripts" folder.
	* Assign Shortcuts to these Scripts using the menu "Edit" > "Keyboard Shortcuts" > "Application Menus" > "File" > "Scripts" section.
2. **Buy a nice extension to have a UI**
	* Copy anyway this folder(s).
	* Buy the "PS Custom Tools Panel" here: http://pspowertools.com
	* Install it and load in it my scripts (keep the PNG icons beside the JSXs).

### Future Fix for my Installers on my roadmap butâ€¦

I'll have time to work on it, but anyway the Scripts will stay here in my Github :)
