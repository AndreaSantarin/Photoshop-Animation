##Photoshop Scripts & Panels for Animation


### What are this Scripts
The 2 folders in that repository come from my 2 extensions/addons "AnimDessin2" and "AnimCouleur2" for Photoshop CC 2014+:
* https://creative.adobe.com/addons/products/1524
* https://creative.adobe.com/addons/products/1592

And the 2 **ZIP files** are the **Manual/Custom Installers** of **AnimDessin2** and **AnimCouleur2**.
* Actually, **these Manual/Custom Installers are the up to date versions of the extensions** because I didn't had the time yet to fix the Addons Portal version!

### Workaround if you have any issue with the installer
The previous installer had an issue with Photoshop CC 2015.5 but it is fixed now.
I leave the following workaround instructions in case of anything like that happened in the future… I hope not!

#### *2 possible Workaround Solutions*
1. **Simply install the Scripts with no UI**
	* Copy the "AnimDessin2-Scripts" and/or "AnimCouleur2-Scripts" folders in your Programs/Applications > "Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.5" (or your version) > "Presets" > "Scripts" folder.
	* Assign Shortcuts to these Scripts using the menu "Edit" > "Keyboard Shortcuts" > "Application Menus" > "File" > "Scripts" section.
2. **Buy a nice extension to have a UI**
	* Copy anyway this folder(s).
	* Buy the "PS Custom Tools Panel" here: http://pspowertools.com
	* Install it and load in it my scripts (keep the PNG icons beside the JSXs).
