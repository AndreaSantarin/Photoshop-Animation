##AnimDessin2 & AnimCouleur2 


### Photoshop Scripts & Panels for Animation
This Section on GitHub contain the Manual installer of my Photoshop Extensions dedicated to cel-animation (frame-by-frame):
* **AnimDessin2:** This panel is designed for Photoshop CC 2014+. It allows you to draw frame-by-image animations (cel-animation like), simplifying the process. it also lets you test the movie and set the duration of a keyframe…
* **AnimCouleur2:** This panel is available for Photoshop CC 2014+. It allows you to simplify the process of coloring frame-by-image drawing animations created with "AnimDessin2".

The 2 **ZIP files** are the **Manual/Custom Installers** of **AnimDessin2** and **AnimCouleur2**.
* Actually, **these Manual/Custom Installers are the up-to-date versions of AnimDessin2** and **AnimCouleur2**.
* I didn't had the time yet to fix the Addons Portal version!

### Workaround if you have any issue with the installer
The previous installer had an issue with Photoshop CC 2015.5 but it is fixed now.
I leave the following workaround instructions in case of anything like that happened in the future… I hope not!

#### *2 possible Workaround Solutions*
1. **Simply install the Scripts with no UI**
	* Copy the "AnimDessin2-Scripts" and/or "AnimCouleur2-Scripts" folders in your Programs/Applications > "Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.5" (or your version) > "Presets" > "Scripts" folder.
	* Assign Shortcuts to these Scripts using the menu "Edit" > "Keyboard Shortcuts" > "Application Menus" > "File" > "Scripts" section.
2. **Buy a nice extension to have a UI**
	* Copy anyway this folder(s).
	* Buy the "PS Custom Tools Panel" here: http://pspowertools.com
	* Install it and load in it my scripts (keep the PNG icons beside the JSXs).
